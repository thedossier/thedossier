# 👋 Hey, I'm @thedossier

💻 **IT & Cybersecurity Enthusiast** focused on **Help Desk**, **Network Operations (NOC)**, and **Security Operations (SOC)**.

I’m building a portfolio of labs, scripts, and monitoring setups that mirror real-world IT operations — from automating help desk workflows to setting up SIEM detections and network monitoring dashboards.

---

## 🧭 What I’m Working On
- 🧰 **Help Desk Automation:** PowerShell and Python scripts for ticketing, system checks, and user management  
- 🌐 **NOC Labs:** Network monitoring with Zabbix, Grafana, and ELK Stack  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **SOC Simulations:** SIEM-based detections, incident response playbooks, and log analysis using Wazuh & Security Onion  
- ☁️ **Cloud & Virtualization:** Lab environments in Azure and VirtualBox

---

## 🧰 Tech Toolbox
**Languages:** PowerShell, Python, Bash  
**Networking Tools:** Wireshark, Nmap, pfSense  
**Security & Monitoring:** Wazuh, Splunk, ELK Stack, Security Onion, Zeek  
**Infrastructure:** Windows Server, Active Directory, VMware, Docker  
**Other Tools:** Zabbix, Grafana, OpenVPN
